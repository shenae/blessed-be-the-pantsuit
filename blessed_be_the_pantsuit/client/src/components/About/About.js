<p class="is-small">This project aims to promote women in politics. With the latest legislation passed limiting a woman's right to alternative birth control, I feel as though this country is mirroring Margaret Atwood's novel "The Handmaid's Tale." Making a pun of the familiar phrase from the book, Blessed Be the Pantsuit was created. Using Ruby on Rails on the backend to create the API, and React for the front end, users can find info on congress women. Being able to email a pre-written letter on Equal Pay to your chosen recipient will also bolster the movement.</p>
